Here's a concise and descriptive prompt based on the web page you uploaded:

**Prompt:**  
"Create a web application called 'Link Playlist Saver' that allows users to organize and manage collections of web links in customizable playlists. The application should include the following features:

1. **Playlist Management**:
   - Create, rename, and delete playlists
   - Drag-and-drop reordering of playlists
   - Special 'Recycle Bin' playlist for deleted items (non-deletable)

2. **Link Management**:
   - Add URLs to playlists with basic validation
   - Edit link titles and add notes
   - Move links to Recycle Bin or permanently delete them
   - Drag-and-drop reordering of links within playlists

3. **User Interface**:
   - Clean, responsive design with WhatsApp-inspired color scheme
   - Two-panel layout: playlist list on left, playlist details on right
   - Visual distinction for the Recycle Bin (different delete button style)

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Save all data to localStorage
   - Handle data migration for existing users

5. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
   - Semantic HTML5 and modern CSS
   - Mobile-friendly design

The application should not require server-side functionality (except for the provided SQL schema which shows how it might be implemented in a database). Focus on creating an intuitive interface for organizing web links with robust client-side functionality."

This prompt captures all the key features and technical aspects of your application while being clear and concise. It would work well for explaining the project to developers or as a basis for further development.
